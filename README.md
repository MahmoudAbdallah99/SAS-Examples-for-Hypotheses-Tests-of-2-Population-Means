# Output explanation
The program gives descriptive statistics and confidence limits for both treatments and their difference. N, Lower CL Mean, Mean, Upper CL, Mean, Lower CL Std Dev, Std Dev, Upper CL Std Dev and Std Err are sample size, lower confidence limit, mean, upper confidence limit, standard deviation of lower confidence limit, standard deviation of values, standard deviation of upper confidence limit and standard error of the mean, respectively. The program calculates t tests, for Unequal and Equal variances, together with corresponding degrees of freedom and P values (Prob>|T|). The t test is valid if observations are drawn from a normal distribution. Since in the test for equality of variances, F = 76.69 is greater than the critical value and the P value is <0.0001, the variances are different and it is appropriate to apply the t test for unequal variances. The P value is 0.1209 and thus H0 cannot be rejected.
